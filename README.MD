# 🚀 PID Identifier

## 🌟 Overview

**PID Identifier** is a Python-based tool that helps you easily **list and manage operating system processes** 🖥️. It provides detailed insights into running and non-running processes, including their:

- 🔢 **PID (Process Identifier)**
- 📛 **Name**
- 🟢🔴 **Status**
- 💾 **Memory Usage**
- 🖥️ **CPU Time**
- 👤 **Username**
- 🕒 **Creation Time**

This tool leverages the `psutil` library for process management and `tabulate` for displaying information in a nice tabular format, making it easier for users to understand and analyze the process information.
